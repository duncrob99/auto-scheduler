# Format:
# <subject title>; <est. time to completion>; <time period>; <min time/time step>; <task subtitle>
#
# subject title: arbitrary string, used for varying subjects on any day
# est. time to completion: float, required time for task in hrs
# time period: either (d)d/(m)m/yy or (d)d/(m)m/yy-(d)d/(m)m/yy, if start date is not given, it is assumed to be today. Otherwise, this this is the period during which the task will be assigned,
# 	       inclusive of start date but exclusive of due date
# min time/time step: float, assigned tasks will always be a multiple of this value in hrs where possible
# task subtitle: arbitrary string, used to give usable output
